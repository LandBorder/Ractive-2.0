This day is called the feast of Crispian. He that outlives this day, and comes safe home, will stand a tip-toe when the day is named, and rouse him at the name of Crispian. 
He that shall live this day, and see old age, will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours, and say to morrow is Saint Crispian. Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.
And say These wounds I had on Crispin’s day.
